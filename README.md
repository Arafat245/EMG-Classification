# EMG-Classification
This repository contains code for basic finger and hand gesture classification using EMG signal as input and some pretrained deep neural 
networks such as -googlenet, Alexnet etc. Dataset has been taken from [Rami Khusaba Electromyogram repository](https://www.rami-khushaba.com/electromyogram-emg-repository.html) [[1]](https://onedrive.live.com/authkey=%21As%5FiNPKzgU6LJCU&id=AAA78954F15E6559%21295&cid=AAA78954F15E6559).
