# EMG-Classification
This repository contains code for basic finger and hand gesture classification using EMG signal as input and some pretrained deep neural 
networks such as -googlenet, Alexnet etc. Dataset has been taken from [Rami Khusaba Electromyogram repository](https://www.rami-khushaba.com/electromyogram-emg-repository.html) [[1]](https://onedrive.live.com/authkey=%21As%5FiNPKzgU6LJCU&id=AAA78954F15E6559%21295&cid=AAA78954F15E6559).

## Steps for running this code
### Step 1
First download the dataset from [this link](https://onedrive.live.com/authkey=%21As%5FiNPKzgU6LJCU&id=AAA78954F15E6559%21295&cid=AAA78954F15E6559). This is the first dataset of [Rami Khusaba Electromyogram repository](https://www.rami-khushaba.com/electromyogram-emg-repository.html). It contains 10 classes of individual finger movements, i.e.,Thumb (T), Index (I), Middle (M), Ring (R),Thumb–Index (T–I), Thumb–Middle (T–M), Thumb–Ring (T–R), Thumb–Little (T–L), hand close (HC), Little (L), Thumb–Little (T–L). We only ussed first 8 classes.
